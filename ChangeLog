	dereferenced registers.

	* src/peripherals/input/input.c: Added a stdin device.
	* src/peripherals/memecho/memecho.c: Added a device that prints any
	changes to the memory, virtual and real.
	* TODO: Updated TODO.

2014-03-05 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* scr/machine/operations.c: Fixed implementation of op_mset() so that it
	correctly parses all 6 possible paramater arrangements (suffixes).
	* README.md: Added a section pertaining to additional projects and added
	h16cc to the list.

2014-03-06 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/machine/processor.c: stdin reading thread. Commented out
	dump_regs() from main().
	* src/machine/operations.h, src/machine/operations.h: op_read() added
	* examples/cat.16c: added a new example of a cat program.

2014-03-26 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/debugger/*: Started a new debugging repl program for the 16c
	platform called '16cdb'.
	* src/machine/operations.c: op_read() now sets the register to 255
	if nothing was read, as that is outside the ascii range. op_write will
	also print '\0' instead of taking mod 127 for ranges above 127.

2014-03-26 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* scr/machine/operations.c: op_write() now will only write if the value
	is in the ascii subset of the c16_words, [0,128].
	* src/machine/processor.c: Fixed the order that the main to prevent data
	races on sysmem.mem caused by process_stdin() racing on the memory
	before it is mapped, or the registers initialized.
	* src/machine/register.h: Fixed the outdated extern register
	declerations.

2014-03-27 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/debugger/commands.c: Added an inp: function to feed input into the
	machine.
	* src/debugger/debug.c: Added the pthread for the stdin, and added a
	pipe to feed to that thread.
	* src/debugger/processor.c: Added a new debugging_op_write() that will
	print in the format of 'machine: %c\n' to seperate the machine's out
	with the debugger's.
	* src/machine/processor.c: Updated the dump_regs() function to be more
	descriptive. Also, fixed the reversed order of subregisers, r*_f
	and r*_b were flipped.
	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Added the pthread library to be linked with the
	debugger.c

2014-03-27 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/debugger/debug.h, src/debugger/debug.c: Moved more of the cli
	interface into this file, changed how commands are formed.
	* src/debugger/commands.h, src/debugger/commands.c: Changed how evaluate
	the commands, all commands return void, and take a char **argv, argument
	parsing is done in before these are called.

2014-03-29 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/debbuger/debug.c: Fixed the fprintf() to add argv[1] fixing the
	undefined behavior in case of a non-valid file.
	* src/debugger/commands.c: Moved the memset() below all
	variable declerations.

2014-03-29 Joe Jevnik <joejev@gmail.com>
	* src/common/arch.h: Fixed the opreg numbers so there is no longer a
	hole between inp_w and r0_f. This allows us to resolve a string to a
	regno by iterating over the list of register strings and checking for
	string equality as seen in parse_regno() in src/debugger/commands.c.
	* src/debugger/commands.c, src/debugger/commands.h: Fixed the
	parse_regno() based on the changes to the regnos.
